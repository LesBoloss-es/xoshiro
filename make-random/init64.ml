(** {1 Init64}

   This module contains one unique functor which, provided a type [state] and a
   few functions to initialise and manipulate it, returns a module similar to
   that of {!Stdlib.Random.State}, containing all the functions that initialise
   and manipulate the state.

   In particular, this functor provide convenient initialisation: it takes a
   number [init_size] and a function [init] able to initialise a state when
   given {b an array of size [init_size] containing already "good" bits} and
   derives from it the function [full_init] generating "good" bits out of an
   array of anything containing any kind integers (the array {b can} be empty
   and {b can} contain only low-entropy integers).

   This is the 64-bits version: the function [init] takes an array of [int64] in
   which all the bits are set. This version is meant to be used for PRNGs whose
   state is made of 64-bits integers (eg. [xoshiro256++]). *)
